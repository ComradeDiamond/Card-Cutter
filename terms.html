        The website here is dedicated completely to the public domain, which has a few implication for you:
        <br /> <br />
        The website is completely clientside. Whatever you choose to do with this software will not
        affect the server in any way, shape, or form. Anything you choose to do with this software
        will only affect your computer. The vice versa is also true - anything that happens to your
        device due to this website is because of something you did.
        <br /> <br />
        This is not a commercial website. No information is collected and sold.
        <br /> <br />
        You can choose to decompile this website (how do you compile js in the first place uwu) or
        mess around with the features however you like.
        <br /> <br />
        Wow did I actually make an entire TOS just because I was using stock images and wanted
        to make some attribution?
        <br /> <br />
        Yea, this is a product of software engineering, not LAS o.o.. 
        Most developers don't really care about any political or legal stuff
        <br /> <br />
        Speaking of why are you even reading this lmao 
        <br /> <br />
        You know engineers barely care about this stuff
